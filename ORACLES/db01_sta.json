/* SALENA 2 July 2023         Comments about changes that I've made
    * change 'born' to 'birth_date' so we can compare dates in a standardized format
    * change 'died' to 'death_date' so we can compare dates in a standardized format
    * Date validation would use these birth_dates. In this case, the validation would fail because:
        * Question if Tom and Mary really had the same birthdays
        * Question if Jane and Mary had the exact same birtdates. Possible but unlikely.
        * These birth_date scenarios are great choices to validate what we are building!!
        * ---> Date validation is a cheap and reliable way that genealogists often use to assess the quality of 
        * others' research or the document itself.
    * Added death date for John Doe. Otherwise, nothing else could happen.
        * And making sure his death date is after Jack's date.
    * Added bequeathed_item keys to the person. In this case, vacuum to Mary and car to Tom for personal items. Jane Doe inherits the house.

    "I, John Doe, bequeath my red car to Tom Doe, my vacuum cleaner to Mary Hoover and my house to Jane Doe."

    * QUESTIONS:
        * Do we want to standardize the dates to DD-MM-YYYY?
        * What is used more for json files with our purposes? UUID or Hex for id numbers?
        * Should we use names of items that contain information like 'personal' or 'real'? In the ID or the name?
