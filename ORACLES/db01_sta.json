/* SALENA 2 July 2023         Comments about changes that I've made
    * change 'born' to 'birth_date' so we can compare dates in a standardized format
    * change 'died' to 'death_date' so we can compare dates in a standardized format
    * Date validation would use these birth_dates.In this case, the validation would fail because:
        * Question if Tom and Mary really had the same birthdays
        * Question if Jane and Mary had the exact same birtdates. Possible but unlikely.
        * These birth_date scenarios are great choices to validate what we are building!!
        * ---> Date validation is a cheap and reliable way that genealogists often use to assess the quality of 
        * others' research or the document itself.
    *QUESTIONS:
        * Do we want to standardize the dates to DD-MM-YYYY?
        * What is used more for json files with our purposes? UUID or Hex for id numbers?
