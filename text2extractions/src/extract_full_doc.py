full_prompt = """You are given the text of a legal will and testament. Extract information about the will and its components using the structured JSON format provided. Each field is mandatory, and the output should be structured precisely according to the schema. Keep the original text when extracting for the ease of retrieving the source of the information.

### Requirements:
1. **Testatorâ€™s name**: The name of the person who wrote and signed the will.
2. **Date of Will**: The date the will was created.
3. **Entities**: Include unique IDs (`e1`, `e2`, etc.) for the following entities:
   - **Testator**: The person who wrote and signed the will
   - **Executor**: The individual appointed to execute the will's instructions 
   - **Assets**: Items or properties owned by the testator
   - **Beneficiaries**: Individuals or entities designated to receive assets or properties
   - **Conditions**: Conditions or shares relevant to bequest event, such as "If beneficiary predeceases testator, transfer to X" or "50%", "1/6", "equally", "per stirpes", etc.
4. **Events**: Include unique IDs (`v1`, `v2`, etc.) for the following events:
   - **Bequest Events**: Event in which a testator bequeaths his/her assets to beneficiaries. Do not group bequests that include different beneficiaries and assets into one event. Treat them as separate bequest events.
5. Use IDs to maintain clarity. Each entity should be assigned a unique ID (e.g., `e1`, `e2`) and referenced in events using these IDs.
